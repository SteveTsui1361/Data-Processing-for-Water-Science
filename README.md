 Daily Streamflow Forcasting by First Order Exponential Smoothing Method

## Introduction
Long_term prediction of streamflow is useful for the planning and operation of water resources. Similarly, short-term prediction of 
streamflow is important for managing extreme events and reservoirs. Several approaches exit to predict streamflow time series, such as 
exponential smoothing method, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and machine learning tools. This code is to use an 
exponential smoothing model for streamflow forcasting using past streamflow timeseries.
